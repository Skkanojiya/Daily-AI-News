    <h2>Vinod Khosla Says AI Will Take 80% of Jobs in 5 Years</h2>
    <p class="blog-meta">By Sagar | 06/08/2025</p>
    <img src="../images/vinoad.png" alt="Vinod Khosla AI Prediction">

    <p>In the fast-paced world of AI, Vinod Khosla warns that AI will take up most of the jobs in the coming years. While AI poses risks, he advises students to focus on broader sectors over just becoming a specialist.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "AI could take over as many as 80% of existing jobs in the next five years. But with every disruption comes opportunity." — Vinod Khosla
    </blockquote>

    <p>Billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has never been shy of bold predictions, and in a recent conversation with Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath, he delivered plenty. Speaking on Kamath’s WTF podcast, the Silicon Valley veteran shared his views on the future of AI, and why the next generation of students might want to rethink everything they thought they knew about careers.</p>

    <p>Khosla did not sugarcoat the disruption that lies ahead. He predicted that in the next five years, AI could take over as many as 80 per cent of existing jobs. While that sounds alarming, he insisted that technology will also create opportunities in ways that are hard to imagine today. This is not the only time he has spoken about it.</p>
